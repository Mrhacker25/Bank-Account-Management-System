# Bank-Account-Management-System
This Java-based console application simulates basic banking operations using Object-Oriented Programming. Users can create new accounts, deposit and withdraw money, view account balance, and exit the program. Each account stores details like account holder name, email, phone, bank name, and auto-generated account number and ID.
